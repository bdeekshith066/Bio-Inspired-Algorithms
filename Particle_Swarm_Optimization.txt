Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Overview
The provided code is an implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to minimize the Rastrigin function, a standard benchmark function used in optimization problems. PSO is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocks or fish schools.

Rastrigin Function
The Rastrigin function is defined as:

f(x) = A * n + Œ£[i=1 to n] (x_i^2 - A * cos(2œÄ * x_i))

Where:

A=10 is a constant.
n is the dimensionality of the input vector x i represents the  ith component of x.
It is highly multi-modal with numerous local minima, making it challenging to optimize.




Key Components of the Code:
Initialization:
Particles' positions and velocities are randomly initialized within the search space.
Each particle has:
    A position representing a candidate solution.
    A velocity dictating the direction and magnitude of its movement.
    A personal best position and score.
The swarm has a global best position and score.
Fitness Evaluation
  the Rastrigin function serves as the fitness function, where the goal is to minimize the output value.

Velocity and Position Update:
Each particle updates its velocity using three components:
    Inertia Weight (ùë§w): Encourages exploration of the search space.
    Cognitive Component (ùëê1): Pulls the particle toward its personal best position.
    Social Component (ùëê2): Pulls the particle toward the swarm's global best position.
The position is updated based on the new velocity.

Boundary Handling:
Particles are constrained to the search space limits using np.clip().

Convergence:
The algorithm iteratively improves the solutions, reporting the best score every 10 iterations.



Applications of PSO:
Engineering Design: Optimization of mechanical, electrical, or structural systems.
Machine Learning: Hyperparameter tuning.
Control Systems: Optimization of PID controller parameters.
Economics: Portfolio optimization or pricing strategy development.
Signal Processing: Filter design.
