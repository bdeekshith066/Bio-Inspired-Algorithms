Genetic Algorithm: Overview
The provided code is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. GAs are widely used for solving optimization problems, especially when the search space is large and complex.


Key Concepts in Genetic Algorithm:
Population: A set of potential solutions (individuals) to the optimization problem.
Fitness Function: Evaluates how good each solution (individual) is.
Selection: Individuals are selected for reproduction based on their fitness (e.g., using roulette-wheel selection).
Crossover (Recombination): Combines two parent solutions to create offspring.
Mutation: Introduces small changes to offspring to maintain diversity in the population.
Generations: Iterative evolution of the population over multiple steps to improve solutions.


Mathematical Notation:
Let f(x) be the fitness function to maximize.
The population evolves such that the fitness of the best individual ùëì(ùë•best) improves or remains stable over time.



Applications in Real-World Problems:
Engineering Design Optimization: Aerodynamics, structural design, or circuit optimization.
Machine Learning: Hyperparameter tuning, feature selection.
Robotics: Path planning and control system design.
Finance: Portfolio optimization and risk management.
Game Development: AI strategies and procedural generation.
